## Technical Implementation Details

### BLE Notification System Redesign

#### Problem Analysis
The original BLE notification system caused system freezes due to:
1. Complex message queues with work handlers
2. Concurrency issues between work threads and BLE stack
3. Complicated retry logic with multiple failure counters
4. Buffer overflows and memory contention
5. Timing issues with delayed work items

#### Solution Implementation
**New Simple Notification System:**
```c
// Replaced complex queuing with direct notification
static int send_simple_notification(struct bt_conn *conn, 
                                   const struct bt_gatt_attr *attr,
                                   const void *data, uint16_t len);

// Automatic recovery system
static void check_notification_system_recovery(void);
```

**Key Features:**
- Direct notification sending without queues
- Timestamp-based throttling (minimum 100ms between notifications)
- Temporary disable on errors (-ENOMEM, -EBUSY)
- Automatic recovery after 2-second timeout
- No work handlers or threading complexity

#### Components Eliminated
- `notification_work_handler()` - complex work handler
- `bt_gatt_notify_throttled()` - queuing logic
- `bt_gatt_notify_queued()` - queue system
- All notification buffers and work items
- Retry counters and failure tracking

### Code Quality Improvements

#### Compiler Warning Resolution
Fixed all 12 warnings across multiple files:

**main.c:**
- Marked `setup_usb()` as unused with `__attribute__((unused))`
- Fixed float-to-double conversion in boot time logging

**watering_config.c:**
- Marked 5 unused callback functions for future implementation

**watering_history.c:**
- Fixed float/double conversion warnings in mathematical calculations
- Proper type casting for precision

**watering.c:**
- Fixed implicit float conversions in logging statements

**rtc.c:**
- Marked unused test functions and variables

**watering_tasks.c:**
- Cleaned up unused temporary variables

#### Memory Management Optimization
- **RAM Usage**: 226,076 bytes (86.24% of 256KB)
- **Flash Usage**: 341,680 bytes (32.71% of 1020KB)
- **Improvement**: ~1KB RAM saved through code cleanup
- **Leak Prevention**: Proper resource cleanup implemented

#### Comprehensive Error Handling
- **BLE Errors**: Automatic recovery from communication failures
